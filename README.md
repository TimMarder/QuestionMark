## Background




## Methodology
On arrays with sizes that increase up to 100, run 1000 trials on each size, testing the time it takes to run the sort. This is ran on 6 different situations. With the pivot position starting on the right, we ran it with unsorted arrays, sorted in ascending order arrays, and sorted in descending order arrays. We did the same for pivot positions starting at a random location.



## Results

## Conclusion

For all our tests when starting on a random pvtPos, the runtime was significantly faster than those of a pvt starting on the right. When running QuickSort with a right pivot, all three tests had similar runtimes. Likewise, the ones running QuickSort with a random pivot were consistent with each other.
